// Java code to demonstrate Builder Pattern

/**
 * a builder pattern can be implemented in such a way that the builder object is
 * only used for constructing the final object and is discarded once the object
 * is built. This eliminates the need for synchronization as the builder object
 * is only accessed by a single thread.
 *
 * In conclusion, builder methods can be made thread-safe by using appropriate
 * synchronization mechanisms and careful implementation.
